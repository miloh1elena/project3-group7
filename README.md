# project3-group7
Added the following files:
- 'clean_data_project3_group7.ipynb', which contains the python code to clean the CSV file.  It changes the dates to a SQL complying format.
- 'project Idea.xlsx', which contains the original file with the idea for the project.
- 'project_data.csv', which contains the original data file pulled from Kaggle.
- 'updated_project_data.csv' which contains the cleaned data for the project with the date column standardized and SQL complying format.
- 'app1.py' which is the python code to create the APIs that would feed that data into the visualizations.
- 'final_data.sqlite' which is the sqlite database file that contains the data for the visualizations.
- Added a 'static' folder to comply with the way in which the flask host works with html and js type files.
- in the 'static' folder:
    - 'index.html' which is the code for the visualization wave page
    - 'plots.js' which is the java script code for the visualizations.
